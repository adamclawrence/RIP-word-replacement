# RIP-word-replacement

RIP Word Replacement is a chrome extension that allows users to change words on the screen that they no longer wish to see.
![Alt text](/examples/trumpBefore.png?raw=true "Trump Before")
![Alt text](/examples/trumpAfter.png?raw=true "Trump After")

Currently, RIP uses a database of common "bad" words and replaces those automatically for the user.
![Alt text](/examples/normalScreen.png?raw=true "Normal Screen")
![Alt text](/examples/changedScreen.png?raw=true "Changed Screen")

If the database is missing a word that a user wants changed, the user can add the word to the database by using the pop up page of the extension.
