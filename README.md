# RIP-word-replacement

RIP Word Replacement is a chrome extension that allows users to change words on the screen that they no longer wish to see. 
Currently, RIP uses a database of common "bad" words and replaces those automatically for the user. If the database
is missing a word that a user wants changed, the user can add the word to the database by using the pop up page of the extension.
